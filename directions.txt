Assignment:

For this assignment you will be creating a digital clock using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The finished product will be fully functional, styled and ready to show off to friends!

Hint: This assignment is to gain the skills needed for development, do NOT submit copied code.

Option 1:

The hex clock is a hex code that reflects the time of day in #hhmmss format instead of hh:mm:ss format. The background color of the screen is then changed based on the hex code which is created by the current time.
